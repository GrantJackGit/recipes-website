# recipes-website
Practice exercise for the Odin Project containing a barebones website with 3 relative links to 3 different recipes.

Before exercise: 
In this lesson, I plan on using the web-building techniques from the modules so 
far. These include paragraphs, links, lists, and images. Both absolute and 
relative links will be used. All of these will be organized using HTML to be as 
aesthetically pleasing as possible, although though the site will be brutalist.
